[ArabicNotepad]

ArabicNotepad is a Java-based text editor designed to handle Arabic and markdown content, providing users with basic text formatting, file management, and analytics tools. The application supports CRUD operations for managing files/books, integrates with MySQL for data storage, and offers advanced features like pagination, transliteration, and TF-IDF analytics. It is built for Windows, with potential to expand to a web version in the future, supporting multiple presentation layers.

[Features]

Markdown Support: Basic formatting and text structuring using markdown language.
File Management: Create, read, upload, delete, and discard files and books with ease (CRUD operations).
Database Integration: MySQL is the primary database, with support for multiple databases through the use of facade and abstract factory patterns.

Analytics: Perform text analytics such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and more to come.
Transliteration: Convert between Arabic script and other writing systems.
Pagination: Efficiently handle large files by displaying content page by page.

Basic Keyboard Shortcuts: Support for commands like:
Ctrl + C: Copy
Ctrl + V: Paste
Ctrl + X: Cut
Ctrl + Z: Undo
Ctrl + Y: Redo

Architecture: Three-layered architecture to separate concerns:
Presentation Layer (UI)
Business Logic Layer
Data Access Layer

Dependency Inversion & Injection: Minimize coupling and promote scalable code design.
Multiple Presentation Layers: Planned expansion to add a web interface alongside the Windows desktop app.
